[Warehouse Migration Notice]

Dear users,

We are delighted to announce that, in order to provide better service and user experience, we will be migrating our warehouse. In the new warehouse, you will enjoy more features and improvements to meet your needs.

During the migration process, access to the original warehouse will be temporarily suspended. During this period, you will not be able to access the content and features in the original warehouse. To ensure that you are not inconvenienced, we have prepared a brand new warehouse that will be activated immediately after the migration is complete.

The new warehouse will offer the following improvements and advantages:

1. Faster loading speed: We have optimized the new warehouse to provide faster loading speed and response time, allowing you to browse and use the warehouse content more efficiently.

2. Memory leak optimization: The new warehouse adopts a brand new connection pool design, greatly improving memory leak issues.

3. Stronger underlying control: The new warehouse has optimized the underlying design, surpassing the official implementation of net/http in terms of connection control and ensuring the complete resolution of memory leak issues.

4. Enhanced stability: The new warehouse uses an optimized http2 library, combined with a deeply optimized connection pool, greatly enhancing the stability and speed of http2.

5. Fingerprint stability: Seamless conversion between ja3 fingerprint, http2 fingerprint, and underlying net.conn implementation eliminates the need for intermediaries, greatly improving performance and stability.

6. More features and resources: We will continue to update and add new features and resources to meet your needs and feedback. You can expect more learning materials, sample code, and tools.

After the migration, you can access the new warehouse by following these steps:

1. Open your browser and visit the URL of the new warehouse: [https://github.com/gospider007/requests].

2. Explore the content, resources, and features of the new warehouse and embark on your learning and exploration journey.

If you encounter any issues or have any questions during the migration process, please feel free to contact me. I am here to provide assistance and support.

Thank you for your continued support and trust in our warehouse. We look forward to exploring and growing together in the new warehouse.

Thank you!
